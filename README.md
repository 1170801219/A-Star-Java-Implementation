# A-Star-Java-Implementation
A*or A Star algorithm java implementation

This is a java implementation of the A Star algoritm. I couldn't find any good java implementations of this famous IA algorithm 
in the web so I decided to make my own. 

The implementation includes 3 files:
  - AStar.java : Main algorithm class.
  - Node.java : Class for the nodes used by the algorithm.
  - AStarTest.java : Test Class for the algorithm
